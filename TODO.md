# CNM To Do

- [x] uv project
- [ ] check for imminent Lehi network password expiration
- [ ] Use https://github.com/IsaacsLab42/lcr_session for auth? It doesn't appear
  to work for cnm in its current form though. Even though the cookies are
  sufficient to make lcr requests, trying to hit the firewall URL redirects back
  to login. Maybe one or more additional cookies needs to be saved at login time.
